# Ski Racing Start Clock

Created this start clock for my ski racing team to use during giant slalom training.

Powered by Arduino Nano.
Functions:
- LCD to display countdown
- Audible countdown sequence mimicing actual race start clock with the same frequencies
- LED strip to display stop/go intervals
- Set custom start interval (time between each racer)
